# EducateVerse


EducatVerse website integrates three services on one platform. Firstly , it provides a section that lists the profound roadmap and resource links needed for any particular domain in the IT industry. We have listed 12. The next section uses a speech to text API in the Interview Practice Questions for various domains. The student can record their answers in real-time on the question displayed and then view it in textual form to assess how well they have done. Database is also used in it. The last part is the Updates section, which consists of all the Internship and Job updates from top companies. It is included so as to make it easy for the user to get the list at one place instead of navigating multiple sites.
